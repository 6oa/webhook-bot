## About This Bot
- This is one of my early builds of my github bot with some missing features such as not being an actual bot.
- This is going to be a little project i can work on from time to time and help out some other people wanting a bot like this
- And alot more to come

### Bot Installation

-  Enter your port as long as its port forwarded it will work
- Go to github-repo/settings/webhooks and create a new webhook like the example below
