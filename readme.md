## About This Bot

- And alot more to come
## Prerequisites

## Node.js Installation
- Open a command prompt inside the folder
- Then run the following command
```bash
  npm install
```
    
### Bot Installation
-  Clone the repo
-  Enter your webhook as the prompt says
-  Enter your port as long as its port forwarded it will work
- Go to github-repo/settings/webhooks and create a new webhook like the example below

```bash
  http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/recieve_github
```
- Replace IP_ADDRESS, Whatever machine the bot is currently being run on. Find the ip address then replace "IP_ADDRESS"
